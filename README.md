# Automation of Security Service Task (Project Deep Blue Season 6)

This project corresponds to the automation of the tasks performed by the security guards of a housing society. Automation of these tasks may enhance the functioning of a society without the need for human intervention and also improve and make the security features more efficient and reliable. Most of our families have smaller children and aged members and we need to ensure their safety. So to prevent such situations and for more efficient security functioning in a society, we chose to try and give an efficient solution to this problem.
